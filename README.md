# Homework for CMSI 3801

Name: Jayden Soto



- **Homework 1 (Scripting)**: Lua, Python, JavaScript

After submission of homework 1, the Lua, Python, and JavaScript folders of the
repository now contain the code of the functions that were previously blank. Now,
along with the already completed change function, functions for first_then_lower_case,
powers_generator, say, meaningful_line_count, and a Quaternion class are also present.
These completed functions should go through and pass most if not all tests in the
exercise test files of each of the respective programming languages.

- **Homework 2 (Enterprise)**: Java, Kotlin, Swift

After submission of homework 2, Java, Kotlin, and Swift folders contain code of all 
functions. THe functions of the code were the same as with homework 1 but now with the
addition of a function for a Binary Search Tree. The completed functions should now pass
the tests within the uncommented test file of each respective language. 

- **Homework 3 (Theory)**: TypeScript, OCaml, Haskell

After submission of homework 3, TypeScript, OCaml, and Haskell folders are completed and 
contain the code that is needed to pass all the tests within the test file. The functions
contained now adds a shape type that will generate three dimensional shapes as well as 
look for its surface area and volume. The shape type as well as all functions should be 
without error and quick to run through the tests.

- **Homework 4 (Systems)**: C, C++, Rust
- **Homework 5 (Concurrency)**: Go
